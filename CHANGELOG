Thrust release 1.0.0 Changelog

Breaking API changes

* Rename top level namespace komrade to thrust.
* Move partition_copy() & stable_partition_copy() into thrust::experimental namespace until we can easily provide the standard interface.
* Rename range() to sequence() to avoid collision with Boost.Range.
* Rename copy_if() to copy_when() due to semantic differences with C++0x copy_if().

Additional features

* Add C++0x style cbegin() & cend() methods to host_vector & device_vector.
* Add transform_if function.
* Add stencil versions of replace_if() & replace_copy_if().
* Allow counting_iterator to work with for_each().
* Allow types with constructors in comparison sort & reduce.

Performance improvements

* merge_sort and stable_merge_sort are now 2 to 5x faster when executed on the parallel device.

Bug fixes

* Workaround an issue where an incremented iterator causes nvcc to crash. (Komrade issue #6)
* Fix an issue where const_iterators could not be passed to transform. (Komrade issue #7)
